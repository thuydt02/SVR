# SVR
The code is to do regression with RBF function (you can change to other function). You can run it with netbeans 8.2 using jdk 32 or 64 bit. The default is to run the doPrediction class with jdk 64 bit (max heap size: 5g, you can increase the heap size as you can but must you jdk 64bit. If jdk 32 max heap size I could set is 1500m)
